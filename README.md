# NEAT and Transformer architecture super_mario_bros

Neuro-Evolution of Augmenting Topologies is an evolutionary approach (a genetic algorithm), that creates and evolves artificial neural networks(ANNs).
It is a black-box optimization technique, an alternative to the more traditional reinforcement learning routes.


The goal here, it's to play the original super mario bros (using gym-super-mario-bros) as the training and testing environment.

 ### Core features of NEAT : 
* incremental growth: start minimally and add nodes and connections only when needed;
  

* historical markings:  make it possible for the system to divide the population into species based on topological similarity;


* speciation of the population: individuals compete primarily within their own niches instead of with the population at large;
topological innovations are protected and have time to optimize their structure, before they have to compete with other  niches in the population.
